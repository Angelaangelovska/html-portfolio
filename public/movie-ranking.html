
<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Lucy</h3>

<p>This is a science fiction action film and it's about a woman, accidentally caught 
    in a dark deal, who turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic. I think it's one of Scarlett Johansson's best movies!</p>

<h3>2. Big Momma's House</h3>

<p>This is a crime comedy film, where an FBI agent reprises his disguise as a corpulent old lady and takes a job as a nanny in a crime suspect's house. <br> 
    It's so fun and the best part is: it's a trilogy!</p>

<h3>3. Beautiful Disaster</h3>

<p>This is a romantic comedy drama film and it's about College freshman, Abby, who tries to distance herself from her dark past while resisting her attraction to bad boy, Travis. <br />
It's a really cool movie!</p>
